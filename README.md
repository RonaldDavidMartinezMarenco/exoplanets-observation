After using the data provided by NASA to determine which exoplanets might be observable by the HWO telescope, a person will be able to interact primarily with the variable diameter, planets and exoplanets within our system, i.e., less than 5 parsec. To be able to execute this code you have to have node.js downloaded and once installed, enter the terminal, go to the folder where the repository is installed, and use the following commands: 1. npm install 2. npm run dev 3. copy the local host in the browser.
